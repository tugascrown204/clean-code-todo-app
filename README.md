# Clean Code Todo App

## Overview
This project is a simple Todo application designed to showcase clean code principles, including meaningful naming, single responsibility, and code organization.

## Features
- Add, delete, and mark todos as complete
- Filter todos by status (all, active, completed)
- Data persistence using localStorage

## Getting Started
To run the application locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clean-code-todo-app.git
   cd clean-code-todo-app
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Clean Code Principles Demonstrated
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables, functions, and classes are named descriptively.
- **Functions Should Do One Thing**: Each function performs a single task, improving readability and maintainability.
- **Organized Structure**: Code is organized into modules for better separation of concerns.
